## ABOUT

Follows this guide [here](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-saas-product-with-next-js-supabase-and-stripe-61f2bc20).

## STEPS

1. Has TailWind and associated setup
2. Has Supabase

## STRUGGLES

1. For some reason, when I attempted to get data from the 'lesson' table, I only get an empty arrow returned. However, when I create a new table 'todo' and attempt to fetch data from that I see all of the values and the returned value is not an empty arrow.  
    * I disabled row level security on the 'lesson' table and the result was the same
    * four spaces and an asterisk in markdown to get a sublist [source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37594372)



2. 

```bash
> node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```
